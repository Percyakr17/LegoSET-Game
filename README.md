<p>Project 1 (LegoSetCompetition)

For this project, you are going to write a program called LegoSetCompetition, in which two players compete to build their legos against each other. So there will be three Lego sets, each with a specified number of pieces. As the game starts, players will begin to build the first Lego set. Once they have built enough pieces to complete the current set, they move on to the next set. Pieces built by a player each day. The number of pieces a player may build each day will vary depending upon the difficulty of features built on any given day. The competition ends when one of the players has completed all three Lego sets. A CompetitionLog class will also be written to log information about the results of the competition.

is a tie and a tiebreaking competition that starts with three brand-new Lego sets. There will be as many tiebreaker rounds as needed until a winner is determined. Whenever a round ends in a tie, the message "The competition ended in a tie. There will be a tiebreaker round" is printed before the new round starts. See sample test 3 below

At the end of the competition, print out the winner and log how much information about which sets each player completed and did not complete, how many pieces each player built, and how long the competition lasted. Creating a CompetitionLog for each player and calling the toString method developed above will be very useful to print out the information corresponding to a particular player.
