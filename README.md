<p>Project 1 (LegoSetCompetition)
Description

For this project, you will be writing a program called LegoSetCompetition that allows two players to compete against each other in building legos. There will be three lego sets each with a specified number of pieces. Players will start by building the first lego set. Once they have built enough pieces to complete the current set, they will move on to the next set. Each day, a player will build a certain number of pieces. The number of pieces a player builds each day may vary depending on the difficulty of the features built on that specific day. The competition ends when one of the players has completed all three lego sets. A class called CompetitionLog will also be written to log information about the results of the competition.

 is a tie and a tiebreaking competition starts with three brand new lego sets. There will be as many tiebreaker rounds as needed until a winner is determined. Whenever a round ends in a tie, the message "The competition ended in a tie. There will be a tiebreaker round" is printed before the new round starts. See sample test 3 below

At the end of the competition, print the winner and log results about which sets each player completed, which sets each player did not complete, how many pieces each player built, and the duration of the competition. Creating a CompetitionLog object for each player and calling the toString() method written earlier will be very helpful for printing the information corresponding to a specific player.
